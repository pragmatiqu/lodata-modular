# pragmatiqu/lodata-modular

This package is a temporary, maintained fork of `flat3/lodata` that adds
support for multiple modular OData endpoints.

It exists primarily to support LaravelUi5 Core during a transition phase.

## Status

- Stable
- Framework-agnostic
- No new features planned
- Intended lifetime: short-term bridge (3–6 months)

## Usage

This package is not intended for general use.
It is consumed internally by LaravelUi5 Core.

## Background

The original implementation was developed in close coordination with the
Lodata maintainer but is currently not part of the upstream release.
